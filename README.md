## Dataset
Our dataset is [Daily trending videos on YouTube](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new).

Preliminary exploratory data analysis can be found [here](https://stat547-ubc-2019-20.github.io/group_2_youtube/docs/milestone1_547.html).

Click [here](https://stat547-ubc-2019-20.github.io/group_2_youtube/docs/finalreport.html) for the final report.

To knit the documents above in `R`, run the following commands in order first:

```
make data/youtube_data.csv
make data/youtube_processed.csv
```
## Dashboard App 
You can find our interactive app to visualize the data [here](https://youtube-app-547.herokuapp.com). 

## Usage

To do the full data analysis and produce the report, follow the instructions below.
### Option 1

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/group_2_youtube`

2. Install the following packages:

- kableExtra
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- knitr
- broom
- here
- glue
- broom
- corrplot
- docopt
- rmarkdown

3. Run the following scripts in order as specified in the base `group_2_youtube` directory on the terminal:

```
# Download data from the web
Rscript scripts/load_data.R --data_url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanrach/youtube_dataset/master/CAvideos.csv"

# Clean data
Rscript scripts/process_data.R --data_path="data/youtube_data.csv" --save_path="data/youtube_processed.csv"

# Create images from exploratory data anlysis
Rscript scripts/eda.R --image_path="images/"

# Peform regression on data and save the model
Rscript scripts/analysis.R --data_path="data/youtube_processed.csv"

# Create a final report in html and pdf format.
Rscript scripts/knit.R --final_report="docs/finalreport.Rmd"
```

### Option 2

- Make sure you have GNU Make on your machine.
- Make sure you are in the base directory `group_2_youtube`.
- You can choose to run the following `make` commands in order:

```
# load data
make data/youtube_data.csv 

# clean data
make data/youtube_processed.csv 

# eda
make images/views_likes.png images/corr_plot.png images/num_vids_category.png images/top10_mean_views_likes.png 

# analysis
make rds/lm.rds rds/glm.rds images/lm_status_views.png images/pois_status_views.png 
		
# knit final report
make docs/finalreport.html docs/finalreport.pdf 
```
- Or you can simply run `make all` to execute the above commands all at once.

- You can run `make clean` to delete all the files in the subdirectories except the scipts.

### Tests

Tests are written to make sure all the dependencies are loaded in. It's likely to be useful if you are not running `make all` and choose to run each step incrementally. 

- Run `test_dir("tests/testthat")` in the base directory `group_2_youtube` in Rstudio console. All the tests should fail in the beginning since the directories are clean.

- After all the steps, all the tests should pass.

## Dashboard proposal

_Description:_ This app, titled “Canadian YouTube Statistics” will allow users to explore the relationships between YouTube video categories, view, comment and like/dislike counts. On the landing page there will be a bar chart that displays the number of videos per category. From a dropdown list, users will be able to filter a scatter plot by video category so that they are able to visualise the relationship between view count and likes/dislikes for their category of interest (e.g. within the video category ‘Music’). Likes and dislikes will be colour coded and regression lines showing the relationship between view number and likes and dislikes will be shown. Similarly, there will be another plot that allows users to filter video categories and explore the relationship between comment count and likes and dislikes for their category of interest. Again, likes and dislikes will be colour coded and there will be regression lines to show relationships between variables. There will also be 2 range slider options for both graphs that allows users to view relationships over a specific range of like/dislike counts. 

_Usage:_ Mary is a psychologist who is trying to understand how certain personalities may be correlated with their level of engagement on social media. To do this she is using video category as a proxy for personality. She is trying to determine whether watching a specific video category means you are more or less likely to comment or press like/dislike. When Mary visits the ‘Canadian YouTube Statistics’ app she will be able to view which video categories are the most popular, and then visualise the relationships between the number of likes/dislikes, comment count and view number. From a dropdown she will be able to filter the scatter plots so that she is viewing the relationships specific to each video category. She is also able to scale the scatter plots so that she is viewing the data for a specific range of like/dislike numbers, e.g. view relationships for video categories with <1000 likes. When she does this, she notices that for the video category ‘Entertainment’, there is the highest correlation between comment count and view number, so she hypothesizes that people who watch films of this category may have a more outspoken personality.
